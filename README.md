# ProveIt

## Project Description: Interactive Proof Learning Tool

### 1. Learning Problem & Empathy Mapping

Many university students struggle to understand and construct mathematical proofs, especially in formal settings like logic or induction. 

Common student challenges include:
- **Confusion without clear steps**: Students often don’t know where to start.
- **Lack of confidence**: Difficulty in writing proofs independently.
- **Desire for approachable learning**: Students want more interactive and less intimidating ways to learn.

### 2. Planned Design Features / Tools

- **Step-by-step proof builder**: Guided templates to structure logical thinking.
- **Box Agent**: A friendly virtual assistant offering tips, encouragement, and hints.
- **Visual proof tree/structure**: Graphical representation to reduce cognitive load and make logic connections clearer.

### 3. Group Roles

- **Sulaiman** – *UX/UI Design*: High-fidelity prototype and interface interaction design.
- **Evan** – *Tech Lead*: Development of the web-based interactive proof interface.
- **Muhammadsultonbek** – *Evaluation*: User testing and feedback analysis.
- **Rishabh** – *Research*: Pedagogical grounding and literature review.

### 4. Pedagogical & Interaction Principles

- **Fading Scaffolding**: Gradually reduce support to build learner independence.
- **Step-by-step Scaffolding**: Helps manage cognitive load and promote learning progression.
- **Emotional Engagement**: Leverage virtual agents and visual encouragement to boost motivation.
- **Constructivism**: Enable learners to build their own understanding through meaningful interaction.

### 5. Intended Outcomes & Measurement

**Outcomes:**
- Improved understanding of proof strategies (initial focus on induction).
- Increased confidence in constructing and explaining proofs.
- Higher retention and engagement with proof-related material.

**Measurement Approaches:**
- Post-activity surveys assessing confidence and comprehension.
- Success rates in proof-building tasks.
- Time-on-task and user engagement metrics.
- Qualitative feedback from user testing.
